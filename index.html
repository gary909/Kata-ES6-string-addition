    <title>ES6 String Addition</title>

    <p>
        It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.<br>
<br>
        Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)<br>
<br>
        ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out <br>
        what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there <br>
        must be a space between the two strings.<br>
<br>
        + , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also <br>
        removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!<br>
        <br>
        If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.<br>
